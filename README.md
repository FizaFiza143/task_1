# Personal Expense Tracker

## Project Objective

This project aims to develop a Python application for tracking and analyzing daily expenses using concepts like file handling, data structures, loops, NumPy, and Pandas.

## Project Tasks

1. **User Input and Data Storage:** Allow users to input expense details (date, category, amount, description) and store them in a CSV file.
2. **Expense Summary and Analysis:** Use Pandas to read, group, and analyze expenses by category, month, and day.
3. **Visualization:** Create charts using Matplotlib or Pandas Visualization to visualize expense distribution, monthly expenses, and daily expenses for a selected month.

5. **Applying Functions and Logic:** Implement functions for adding, deleting, and summarizing expenses.
6. **Advanced Features (Optional):** Incorporate regular expressions, exception handling, and keyword-based search for enhanced functionality.
7. **User Interaction:** Provide a menu-driven interface for user interaction with the application.
8. **Using NumPy for Statistical Analysis:** Utilize NumPy to calculate statistical measures (highest, lowest, average) and identify spending trends.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a CSV file named `tracker.csv` to store and manage expense data.

## Usage

1. Run the code cells in the notebook to execute the application.
2. Follow the menu prompts to interact with the expense tracker.
3. Refer to the code comments for detailed explanations of the functionalities.
